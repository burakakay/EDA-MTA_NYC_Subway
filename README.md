### Scenario 
WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) organizes an annual gala at the beginning of the summer season. They are a new and inclusive organization where they are trying to prepare for double duty with the gala to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing women's contribution to technology and creating universal reach simultaneously.
For this purpose, WTWY places street teams in the girls of metro stations. It collects the e-mail addresses of people the street teams can reach and sends free tickets to our gala to those who register.
If there is room to request your help, use the MTA subway system, which is sure to be available free of charge from the city, to help optimize the placement of street crews, so we can reach the most people
